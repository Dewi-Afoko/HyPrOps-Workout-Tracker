###This isn't an actual read me, this is just so I can remember the last thing I did... ðŸ˜…


## **Started Creating Pages, Pivoted to Token Implementation**

- Landing and registration pages created
    - Feature boxes outlining user functionality populated
    - Styling needs correcting

- Backend JWT implementation started, but routes using it not created
    - App.py updated

# UPDATE:

- Backend routing for registration with hashed passwords implemented
- Login backend/HTTP requests functional
- Tokens awarded as they should be
- All routes that should require tokens now do - and work with them
- Signup page/component on frontend working
    - Styling needs fixing as does post-registration behaviour
