## This isn't an actual read me, this is just so I can remember the last thing I did... ðŸ˜…


## **Current task**

- Finalise workout display, creation and adding details
    - What pages? All on the same?
    - Click through for details?

### **Started Creating Pages, Pivoted to Token Implementation**

- Landing and registration pages created
    - Feature boxes outlining user functionality populated
    - Styling needs correcting

- Backend JWT implementation started, but routes using it not created
    - App.py updated

### UPDATE:

- Backend routing for registration with hashed passwords implemented
- Login backend/HTTP requests functional
- Tokens awarded as they should be
- All routes that should require tokens now do - and work with them
- Signup page/component on frontend working
    - Styling needs fixing as does post-registration behaviour
- Login frontend functional
    - Component complete
    - Page complete
    - token and user ID passed to localStorage
- MVP workout page in progress, blended with profile page
    - All workout details displayed
        - Looks awful, but data readily available
- Auth headers added to all relevant frontend components
- Get Workouts component no longer a button, returns list
    - Needs to be adapted to useState

## NEXT UP:

- Add state where relevant
- Figure out the add details component config and frontend logic


## TODO:

- Potentially sessions over localStorage?
- useNavigate
- Navbar
